# Colosl Code Challenge

## Help!

If you're reading this, you've been selected to tackle a classic scenario in the software engineering world: inheriting a project that seemed fine until tests were written.

## How did we end up here?

Your coworker built what appeared to be a polished, fully functional NextJS authentication application. But alas, they delayed writing tests until the end of the project. Once the tests were written it became clear that the application was super broken and does not meet the specified product requirements. Now we need your help! Update the codebase so that the written tests pass.

## Your Mission

Your task is to:

1. Review the existing code and accompanying tests.
2. Identify where and why the application fails to meet the test scenarios.
3. Refactor or rewrite the necessary parts of the application.
4. Ensure that all tests pass.

## Setup Instructions

Here's how to get started with this project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:colossal-digital/colosl-js-code-test.git
cd colosl-js-code-test
npm install
npm run test
```
